**Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset 2** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial domain and surface defect detection research. 

The dataset consists of 3336 images with 394 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*defect*).

Images in the KolektorSDD2 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 2980 (89% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1004 images) and *train* (2332 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [University of Ljubljana, Slovenia](https://www.uni-lj.si/university/).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
