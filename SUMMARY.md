**Kolektor Surface-Defect** (Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset 2) is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 3336 images with 394 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*defect*).

Each image in the Kolektor Surface-Defect dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 2980 (89% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2332 images) and *test* (1004 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
