**Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset 2** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 3336 images with 394 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (_defect_).

Each image in the Kolektor Surface-Defect dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 2980 (89% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: _train_ (2332 images) and _test_ (1004 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
