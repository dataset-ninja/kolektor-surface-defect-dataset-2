**Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset 2** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the surface defect detection and industrial domains. 

The dataset consists of 3336 images with 394 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*defect*).

Images in the KolektorSDD2 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 2980 (89% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2332 images) and *test* (1004 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
